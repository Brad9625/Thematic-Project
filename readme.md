# Project Structure

To keep everything organised, the repo is split into three main folders:

## designs
Contains all design-related work.
- Initial concepts
- Figma designs
- UI/UX ideas

All files here are related to art/the design process and not needed for the site itself

---

## tests
Used to manage the development things we are working on, for example if youre designing a webpage, or a database, put it in here until its done, then integrate it into the website (not required, just preferred)
- New features
- Backend/frontend prototypes
- Testing things that may not work

Anything here can later move into the `website` folder once it’s ready, or could remain here for eternity as a testiment to your efforts :p

---

## website
The main project
- Current working version
- What we present and submit
- The actual website/app

Only stable, finalised features should be here.

---

### Workflow Idea
Design → test in `tests` → move to `website` when complete.
Tests is not a necessity, but may help if youre doing iterative development, develop how and when you want
